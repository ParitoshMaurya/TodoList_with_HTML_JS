# TodoList with HTML JS

In this project, I have made a TodoList using BootStrap and basics of JavaScript. In this Todo, I have used localstorage to store the user's task and all. I have also added the task search functionality. I have included the JavaScript code in script tag in HTML file only.

## Topics Covered in this Project
- localstorage
- ES6
- BootStrap

With the help of any browser you can run the `ToDoList.html` and start using it.
